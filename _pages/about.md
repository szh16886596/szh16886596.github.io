# About Me

I'm currently pursing my Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yinliang Xu](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/xyl_en/main.htm). 

I'm a member of Energy Management System Laboratory led by Prof. [Hongbin Sun](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/shb.htm), Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University.

My research interests include power system optimization and control, decarbonization of the power system, and the application of data-driven method in power systems.

My CV is [here](../assets/Zehao_Song_CV.pdf).
